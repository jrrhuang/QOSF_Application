The goal of the task is to implement a basic quantum circuit simulator using code. Quantum states can be represented as vectors, with entries denoting amplitudes
of the basis states, and quantum logic gates are represented as matrix operators. Quantum states are not directly observable, so they will collapse to the
classical bit state upon measurement. This is dependent on the amplitudes
